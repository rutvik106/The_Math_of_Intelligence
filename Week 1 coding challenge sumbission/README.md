# Predict your Happiness based on your Freedom

This is a Coding Challenge Submission for week 1 of "The Math of Intelligence" by Siraj Raval on Youtube. Here I have taken a dataset of World Happiness Report (Happiness scored according to economic production, social support, etc.) from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness) from which I have taken 2 variables in considaration (Freedom and HappinessScore).

## Coding Challenge -- Due Date, Thursday June 22nd, 2017

This week's coding challenge is to implement gradient descent to find the line of best fit that predicts the relationship between
2 variables of your choice from a [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) dataset. Bonus points for detailed documentation. Good luck! Post your github link in the youtube comments section

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/xRJCOz3AfYY) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. The dataset represents distance cycled 
vs calories burned. We'll create the line of best fit (linear regression) via gradient descent to predict the mapping. yes, I left out talking about the learning rate in the video, we're not ready to talk about that yet.
